# Github basics
_How to set up a repository for your group project_

## Prerequisites
- Create a Github account at [github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
- Optional: [Read about how to write in the Markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Why do we need you to do this? (komt een website) metadata, 
- Every projectgroup is working on a project
- Every projectgroup has members, a topic, data sources, a final product, allof that is metadata
- The documentation of your project is elsewhere
- From each team we need one member to create a repository using our template and we need all members to add their own profile page.

## Creating a project repository
I will now walk you through our Github environment and show you how to create a repository for all the metadata about your project. If you are already experienced with either the Github desktop GUI or using Git in a terminal, you can fork the repo and edit code in your own way, just be sure to end up with a proper fork of the template and add your team members as collaborators. If that last sentence didn't make any sense to you, follow my lead :)

- **One person in the team**: Click on fork
    + Change the name of the repository to your title
    + You can now share the link of your project repository with your team
- Edit the main readme by clicking on the edit button shaped like a pencil in the top right of the opened README.md file
    + Now you see the code behind this page, we'll edit this code so the page reflects your project
    + Click on Preview Changes to see the rendered version of the page. This is what it will look like to people visiting the page.
    + The code we're writing is a special type of text that allows us to describe what the text should look like. This text format is called Markdown and this tutorial is also written in Markdown.
    + Let's change the title, we'll leave picture for later
    + You can remove the brackets
    + Things that are links will need the brackets
    + Let's fill in team members, be mindful of mistakes like extra spaces
    + Now preview the changes
    + Great, now let's change the locations
    + Lookup locations on wikidata
    + Accidentally click on amsterdam link, dont go away from page, we still need to save our changes
- Let's commit our changes
    + Write a very short description
    + Commit directly to main branch
    + Check out the result
    + You can always change the information in your repository. As long as you stick to our template, our website (which we still have to build) will update automagically.
- Let's add a personal page
- Let's upload a picture. Give it a simple name like just your first name. Be mindful of capitalized letters.
    + Let's change the name of the file to yourname.md
    + Commit the change by giving it a name (added profile picture)
    + If you know how to, choose a small image
    + We can change the name to name.jpg
    + Image won't work until we've added it
    + Let's add some other fields, be careful with syntax errors
- Let's add the rest of the team as Collaborators
    + Go to notifications
    + accept invite
    + go to group folder
- Other team members
    + Atfter creating your Github account,
    + Go to your [notifications](https://github.com/notifications)
    + accept the invite for your group's repository
    + go to group folder
    + Open the profile page (someone'sname.md) of a group member, click on the edit button and copy the markdown code
    + Now click cancel (we don't want to edit their page) and then click add file, 
    + copy the pasted code and edit it so it reflects your info.
    + Check out the steps above to see how to add your picture
- Finally, check out the forks created by other groups [by going here](https://github.com/cross-cultural-data-literacy/2021-project-template/network/members) and clicking on the links to their repositories.
- If you followed all steps correctly, your project repo should look something [like this example project](https://github.com/LeonievanDijk020/Pandemic-Sporting-in-Public-Space) made by the coordinators of this programme.
